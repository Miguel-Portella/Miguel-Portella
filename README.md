## About Me
I am a systems-oriented student with strong interest in robotics, backend development, and applied artificial intelligence.

My experience comes primarily from hands-on problem-solving in robotics competitions, software projects, and technical leadership roles. I focus on understanding how systems behave under constraints and how software logic interacts with real-world limitations.

## Areas of Interest
- Robotics systems and control logic
- Backend development and system architecture
- Software reliability and problem-solving under constraints
- Applied artificial intelligence

## Technical Skills
- Programming: Python, PHP, JavaScript
- Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js
- Databases: MySQL
- Tools: Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Figma

## Projects
- Robotics Systems Logic – OBR Artistic Modality
- Backend and Web Systems Projects (Python, PHP, JavaScript)

## Learning Philosophy
I learn best through experimentation, iteration, real systems rather than purely theoretical exercises.

## Overview
This repository documents the system logic and design decisions of a robotics project developed for the Brazilian Robotics Olympiad (OBR), Artistic Modality.

## System Description
The robot was designed to execute coordinated movements under time and resource constraints. The system integrated mechanical components, sensors, and control logic to ensure predictable behavior during performances.

## My Role
- Control logic design
- System debugging and reliability testing
- Team coordination and task distribution

## Challenges & Engineering Decisions
- Limited time for testing required prioritization of robustness over complexity
- Iterative refinement of movement sequences to reduce failure points
- Debugging inconsistent behavior caused by hardware constraints

## Skills Demonstrated
- Systems thinking
- Control logic
- Problem-solving under constraints
- Team leadership in technical environments
